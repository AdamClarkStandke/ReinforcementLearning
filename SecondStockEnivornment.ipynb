        "# Second Stock Trading Environment\n",

        "> This second stock environment is based on Adam King's article as found here:[Create custom gym environments from scratch — A stock market example](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-custom-openai-gym-environment-for-stock-trading-be532be3910e). Similar to the first stock trading environment based on Maxim Lapan's implementation as found in chapter eight of his book [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On: Apply modern RL methods to practical problems of chatbots, robotics, discrete optimization, web automation, and more, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-optimization/dp/1838826998), the agent is trading in the environment of the [SPY ETF](https://www.etf.com/SPY?L=1) except in this trading environment the agent is taking continuous actions, rather than discrete actions and is tasked with managing a [trading account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingaccount.asp#:~:text=A%20trading%20account%20is%20an,margin%20requirements%20set%20by%20FINRA.).  In the first trading environment, the agent's reward is based on relative price movement, however in this trading environment the agent's reward is based on managing its trading account. As Adam King details the agent can take two continous actions; namely, either buying or selling the SPY and by what percentage. \n",
